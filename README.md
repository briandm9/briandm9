Web Trainee Developer

Hi there! I'm Brian Matoso, a web trainee developer with a passion for backend development and JavaScript technologies.

Before diving into web development, I created plugins for AMX Mod X using Pawn. That sparked my curiosity about programmation, and now I'm fully focused on building web applications.

I studied through national programs from Argentina like **Argentina Programa** and **Codo a Codo**, and I keep practicing every day to grow as a developer.

Technologies I'm working with:
- 游릴 HTML
- 游릴 CSS
- 游릴 JavaScript
- 游릴 Node.js
- 游릴 Express
- 游릴 SQL
- 游릴 MongoDB

I enjoy backend development the most, but I regularly practice frontend as well.

My goal: Keep learning and improving every day to become a skilled developer.
